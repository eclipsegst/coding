 * Enum Singleton
 * 
 * Making a class a Singleton can make it difficult to test its clients, 
 * as itâ€™s impossible to substitute a mock implementation for a singleton 
 * unless it implements an interface that serves as its type. 
 * Recommended approach is implement Singletons by simply make an enum type with one element.
 * 
 * "This approach is functionally equivalent to the public field approach, 
 * except that it is more concise, provides the serialization machinery for free, 
 * and provides an ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation, 
 * even in the face of sophisticated serialization or reflection attacks. 
 * While this approach has yet to be widely adopted, 
 * a single-element enum type is the best way to implement a singleton."
 * 
 * - "Effective Java"
 * 
 * Note:
 * enum fields are compile time constants, but they are instances of their enum type. 
 * And, they're constructed when the enum type is referenced for the first time.
